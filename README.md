This software imitates a bank account, allowing the user to withdraw and deposit
funds and read their bank statement.

## Quick start

- Fork and clone this repository
- Run ```bundle install``` in your terminal
- This programme is used in the terminal: Require files "account.rb",
"balance.rb" and "statement.rb" in IRB
- To run the tests, run ```rspec``` in your terminal

## My approach to solving the challenge

1. Planning through domain modelling of required classes
2. Adhering to TDD processes:
  - Feature test to test the interaction between objects
  - Unit test to test the functionality of a class
  - Write the code to pass
  - Refactor where required
3. Run Rubocop before each commit to check code quality
4. Once the core of the programme was complete, tackling edge cases repeating
the steps above
